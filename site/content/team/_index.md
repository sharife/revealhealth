# **Mona Ezzat-Velinov, MD, ABIHM**  

<img src="/img/fpo.png" style="float:right; padding:16px"> Mona Ezzat-Velinov is a Primary Care doctor who has been practicing for over 20 years, and the founder of New Roots, a Functional Medicine practice helping patients find answers to their chronic disease. 

Following residency training at the University of Michigan, she went on to work in underserved areas around the country. She then moved to Northern California practicing in a community setting for over 10 years. When her own health started to take a turn for the worse, she pursued other areas of healing, leading her to Integrative and Functional Medicine. Looking to deliver care in a new way, Mona joined One Medical Group and then Crossover Health, providing care directly to employees of Apple and Facebook via onsite clinics.

Mona has seen first hand how preventive care and catching a disease process early is important to helping patients stay on the healthy track, instead of decline. Through a vigorous training program and numerous conferences, Mona continues to immerse herself in cutting-edge medical care.
