      With the insights provided by genomics, microbiome, and mitochondria
      balance, we look at all the factors of our lifestyle which lead to
      heightened vitality. <br /><br />Our wellness programs focus on brain
      health, sleep, gut health, and stress management, with options to
      customize a program for your organization.


      Step One:

      Validated assessment tools for overall health as well as nutritional
      assessment, emotional health and resilience  


      Step Two:

      Specific lab testing with an eye toward early markers indicative of
      disease processes with the opportunity for genomic testing


      Step Three:

      Health tracking for lifestyle inputs to follow changes in subjective and
      objective function

      Technology for sleep, fitness and nutrition we reveal trends in health.

      Telemedicine support from our team of practitioners provide the guidance
      to making lasting changes in lifestyle and improve biomarkers.

      An increasing number of people are developing diabetes and prediabetes,
      without much guidance toward improving their insulin/glucose ratio. Many
      studies have demonstrated the ability to reverse diabetes and prediabetes
      through a lifestyle program. <br /><br />The interaction of the gut
      microbiome, hormonal signaling, liver health, and inflammation combine to
      lead to issues such as diabetes, prediabetes and fatty liver. Helping a
      person understand this cascade and addressing all the lifestyle factors
      will reverse the process.

      Current treatment for autoimmune conditions rely on expensive biological
      medications, the use of which do not heal the body, but rather modify the
      immune cascade that has started.  Moving upstream to the root of the
      issue, there are often many ways to heal autoimmune conditions using
      lifestyle to support the healing process. <br /><br />Autoimmune disease
      has an underlying trigger of imbalance causing tissue to change and the
      immune system to respond as it is programmed to. Gut health, microbiome,
      environmental stress and hormonal imbalance can produce the autoimmunity.
