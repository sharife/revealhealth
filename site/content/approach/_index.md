      One of the most far-reaching health issues affecting more people in the United States than any other disease and is the leading cause of mortality. Cardiovascular disease is reversible and manageable when it is considered through the lens of systems biology thinking. <br /><br />Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, smoking are all risk factors for heart disease and all share the common thread of inflammation. Addressing the underlying inflammatory status removes the drive for an inflammatory cascade thus preventing cardiovascular disease.

    text: >
      An increasing number of people are developing diabetes and prediabetes, without much guidance toward improving their insulin/glucose ratio. Many studies have demonstrated the ability to reverse diabetes and prediabetes through a lifestyle program. <br /><br />The interaction of the gut microbiome, hormonal signaling, liver health, and inflammation combine to lead to issues such as diabetes, prediabetes and fatty liver. Helping a person understand this cascade and addressing all the lifestyle factors will reverse the process.

  - heading: "Autoimmune conditions"
    text: >
      Current treatment for autoimmune conditions rely on expensive biological medications, the use of which do not heal the body, but rather modify the immune cascade that has started.  Moving upstream to the root of the issue, there are often many ways to heal autoimmune conditions using lifestyle to support the healing process. <br /><br />Autoimmune disease has an underlying trigger of imbalance causing tissue to change and the immune system to respond as it is programmed to. Gut health, microbiome, environmental stress and hormonal imbalance can produce the autoimmunity.
